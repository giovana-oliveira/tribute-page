            <h2 id="headline">Here's a timeline of Katherine Johnson's life:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><b>1918</b> - Born in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.</li>
            <li><b>1932</b> - After she reached the limit of education available to black children in White
               Sulphur Springs, Johnson moved to Institute and enrolled at West Virginia State College,
                at the age of 15.</li>
            <li><b>1937</b> - At the age of 18, she graduated <i>summa cum laude</i>, with degrees in mathematics
               and French. She took on a teaching job at a black public school in Marion, Virginia.</li>
            <li><b>1939</b> - After marrying her first husband, James Goble, she left her teaching job and
               enrolled in a graduate math program. She quit one year later after becoming pregnant and
                chose to focus on her family life. She was the first African-American woman to attend
                 graduate school at West Virginia University in Morgantown, West Virginia. </li>
            <li><b>1953</b> - The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (the predecessor to NASA) opened hiring to
               African-Americans and women, and Johnson was hired as a research mathematician. There, Johnson
                worked as a "computer", analyzing topics such as gust alleviation for aircraft.</li>
            <li><b>1956</b> - Her husband James Goble lost his battle with brain cancer and Katherine became a widow.
               Despite the loss she stayed busy at work and continued to press for inclusion in key project capacities.
                Working on a secret program with core members of her agency’s flight dynamics branch,
                 Katherine helped author the first textbook on space.</li>
            <li><b>1961</b> - Johnson calculated the trajectory for Shepard’s 1961 flight, the second manned
               space voyage and the first American one.</li>
            <li><b>1969</b> - Helped calculate the trajectory for the 1969 Apollo 11 flight to the Moon.</li>
            <li><b>1970</b> - Worked on the Apollo 13 Moon mission. When the mission was aborted, her work
               on backup procedures and charts helped set a safe path for the crew's return to Earth,
                creating a one-star observation system that would allow astronauts to determine their
                 location with accuracy.</li>
            <li><b>1986</b> - Retired from NASA.</li>
            <li><b>2015</b> - Awarded the U.S Presidential Medal of Freedom</li>
            <li><b>2016</b> - NASA honored her by naming a building after her.
               The building is called the Katherine G. Johnson computational research facility.
                The book <i>Hidden Figures</i> and it's film adaptation were released, telling
                 the story of Johnson and other African-American mathematicians
                  (Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughan) who worked at NASA.</li>
            <li><b>2020</b> - Died at the age of 101.</li>
          </ul>
